# Bookshelf
This is a selection of books I own, inspired by <https://patrickcollison.com/bookshelf>. My favorites are marked with a âœ¨.
The list is generated from my Goodreads account.

Want to talk books? tweet/DM me at [@{{site.twitter_username}}]({{site.twitter_url}}){:target="_blank"}

{% assign sorted-books = site.data.goodreads_library_export | sort: 'Date Added' %}

{% assign read-books = sorted-books | where: "Exclusive Shelf","read" %}

## Read
{% for book in read-books %}
- {% if book["My Rating"] == "5" %}âœ¨ {%endif%}{{ book["Title"] }}
{% endfor %}

## Currently Reading
{% assign current-books = sorted-books | where: "Exclusive Shelf","currently-reading" %}
{% for book in current-books %}
- ðŸ“– {{ book["Title"] }}
{% endfor %}

## Up Next
{% assign to-read = sorted-books | where: "Exclusive Shelf","to-read" %}
{% for book in to-read %}

{% endfor %}
