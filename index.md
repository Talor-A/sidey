I build exciting things with code.

In the past, I was a developer at [Scratch.app](//scratch.app){:target="_blank"} building an educational platform for students, teachers, and universities. Right now, I'm finishing my B.S. in Computer Science at [Cal Poly Pomona](https://www.cpp.edu/sci/computer-science/){:target="_blank"}. My focus has been in software engineering and machine learning. After that, I'm joining [Intuit](https://intuit.com){:target="_blank"} as a Software Engineer.


I love climbing and walking my [dog üêï](https://instagram.com/thatsabiglab){:target="_blank"}.

**Things I think about a lot:**

* how the [internet](https://runyourown.social/#how-to-run-a-small-social-network-site-for-your-friends) affects our [relationships](https://youshoulddateppt.com) and [identity](https://www.snap.com/en-US/news/post/the-liquid-self)
* how technology can improve education
* sustainability and environmental awareness
* making [technology](https://kottke.org/20/02/billie-eilish-interviewed-by-ai-bot) more [human](https://jackcheng.com/the-slow-web/)
