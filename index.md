I build exciting things with code.

I'm an incoming New Grad Software Engineer at [Intuit](https://intuit.com){:target="_blank"}.

In the past, I was a developer at [Scratch.app](//scratch.app){:target="_blank"} building an educational platform for students, teachers, and universities. Right now, I'm finishing my B.S. in Computer Science at [Cal Poly Pomona](https://www.cpp.edu/sci/computer-science/){:target="_blank"}. My focus has been in software engineering and machine learning.

I love climbing and walking my [dog üêï](https://instagram.com/thatsabiglab){:target="_blank"}.

* how the internet shapes our [relationships](https://youshoulddateppt.com) and [identity](https://www.snap.com/en-US/news/post/the-liquid-self)
* improving technology through education
* sustainability and environmental awareness
