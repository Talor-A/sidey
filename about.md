I build exciting things with code.

I'm ~~an incoming~~ \*officially\* a New Grad Software Engineer at [Intuit](https://intuit.com){:target="_blank"}.

In the past, I was a developer at [Scratch.app](//scratch.app){:target="_blank"} building an educational platform for students, teachers, and universities. I hold a B.S. in Computer Science from [Cal Poly Pomona](https://www.cpp.edu/sci/computer-science/){:target="_blank"}, focused in software engineering and machine learning.

My work is through the screen of a computer, but my heart belongs to the outdoors. I love climbing and walking my [dog 🐕](https://instagram.com/thatsabiglab){:target="_blank"}.

**I'm inspired by:**

* making the web [smaller](https://runyourown.social/#how-to-run-a-small-social-network-site-for-your-friends){:target="_blank"}, [slower](https://jackcheng.com/the-slow-web/){:target="_blank"}, more [friendly](https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/){:target="_blank"}, and more [human](https://medium.com/@the_i_i/were-a-niche-we-just-didn-t-know-9561f662e127){:target="_blank"}.
* how the internet shapes our [relationships](https://youshoulddateppt.com){:target="_blank"} and [identity](https://www.snap.com/en-US/news/post/the-liquid-self){:target="_blank"}
* improving technology through education
* sustainability and environmental awareness
