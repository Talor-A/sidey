I've added a [books](https://taloranderson.com/books) page to the site. I've enjoyed browsing through several other individuals' virtaul bookshelves, incl. [Patrick](http://visakanv.com/bookshelf/), [Visa](http://visakanv.com/bookshelf/), and others. It's one of my new year's resolutions to add at least 6  pages / posts to this site by 2022, so I'm glad to be getting one out of the way quickly!
