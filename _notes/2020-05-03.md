feeling extremely inspired today after watching REI's film "[How to Run 100 Miles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC7Lh4opLsc)". 

Covid has basically killed climbing for me for a good while, so I'm looking at other outlets like running & biking.

They don't come as easy with asthma, unfortunately. But man would I love to start training for a marathon.
