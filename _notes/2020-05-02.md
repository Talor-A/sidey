owning a website in 2020:

1. build it yourself. be cheap. be low-tech.
2. use semantic html.
3. use minimal css.
4. make your content portable. what's yours is yours. write in markdown & use a generator. don't mix content & formatting.
5. don't use (more than a little) javascript.
6. respect your visitors and they'll respect you. 
7. POSSE.
8. individuals > corporations. be IndieWeb. be distributed.

I tried to follow these as best as I could on my site. I'll try to write up more on how I did it sometime.
