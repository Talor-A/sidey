Another day in limbo. Stasis. A place where time is slowly disappearing, except in the eddy currents of routines carried over from a past life. When everything else is melting away, I'm taking the time to realign my priorities and reconnect with the things that mean the most to me. Taking a moment to read in the sun and hear the leaves has never felt as good as it does just now.

The book I'm reading right now is *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance*. I'm falling more and more in love with it with each chapter. The themes in the story are starting to coalesce and paint this great big picture and I really think it's something special, or at least it's what I need right in this moment. 

There's a scene in the book when the author & his son are summiting a mountain and come to a patch of forest where there's no underbrush, only a soft bed of pine needles underfoot. Oh, to be in an ancient forest like that now. Where the sun shines between the trees that seem to extend on and on forever.

*remembering a hike with my girlfriend*

Missing the feeling of exploration and fresh air a little extra right now. I was supposed to be in Bishop celebrating a birthday, but instead I'll have to settle for home. That's life, I guess. I'm of course disappointed that everything for the forseeable future has been cancelled - I can't have a commencement or grad party (who knows when I'll see my school friends again, especially the ones graduating), I missed a festival, and most of all I'm missing climbing (in the gym and all the trips I had planned).

But more important is to be grateful - for so many things. I'm happy that I have a loving family and a girlfriend to spend my time with, and that they're all still healthy. I'm grateful for my own good health, and I hope this disease will be cured soon.
