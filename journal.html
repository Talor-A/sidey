<p>
  these are notes to me. I journal a few pages every morning (or at least I try). The interesting bits I'll post here.

<section class="posts">
{% for post in site.notes %}
<strong>
  <time datetime="{{ post.date | date_to_xmlschema }}">{{ post.date | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}</time>
</strong>
<p>
  {{post.content}}
</p>
{% endfor %}
</section>
