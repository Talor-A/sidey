# How this website was made

[This website](https://github.com/Talor-A/talordotdev) is created with the blogging site generator [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

The styles are done with minimal markup, using [awsm.css](https://igoradamenko.github.io/awsm.css/) for nice styles with no CSS classes needed for most of the site.

only JS used is for light / dark mode toggle (cuz it's awesome), and the zoom feature when you click on a picture.
