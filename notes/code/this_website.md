title: How this website was made
---

[This website](https://github.com/Talor-A/talordotdev) is created with the blogging site generator [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

The styles are done with minimal markup, using [awsm.css](https://igoradamenko.github.io/awsm.css/) for nice styles with no CSS classes needed for most of the site.

only JS used is for light / dark mode toggle (cuz it's awesome), and the zoom feature when you click on a picture.

I write all my content in Typora.

This idea for a personal sort of wiki came from [Tom Critchlow](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/).
